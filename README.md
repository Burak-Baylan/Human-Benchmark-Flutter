# Human Benchmark
#### My little flutter project.

# Important 
I made the games in this project by looking at the [Human Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com).

# Description
The purpose of the application is to test yourself with 3 different games.

● Reaction Time Game: When the red color turns green, click on the screen fast as possible.  
● Numbers Memory Game: You need to memorize a series of numbers and then write them.  
● Sequence Memory Game: You need to keep in mind an ever-growing order.  

With these 3 games, you can improve your memory and hand-eye coordination.  
The application is only available on Google Play. In this application,
I used GetX as state management and added ads with Google Ads.
